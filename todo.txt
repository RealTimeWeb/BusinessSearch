Todo:
 * Should local be the default? Already have the connect() method to make
   remote connections, so maybe if you do nothing, you get the local data
   store?

 * Must be built with Java 6 to support Android, not Java 7
   
 * Update Docs for listeners

 * Rewrite getBusinessData method to take an existing Business and fill it in,
   rather than an ID and returning a new object (though, we probably want the
   original too)

 * Business should have an isComplete() method describing whether it is the
   "shallow" preview returned by the search or the "full" data returned by the
   individual getter
   
Done:
 * Put everything in an appropriate top-level package: webinacan.yelp.*
 
 * Listeners must be interfaces, not classes.

 * No need for separate ExceptionListener; just give methods in each listener
   interface more meaningful names, like businessSearchCompleted,
   businessSearchFailed, businessDataCompleted, businessDataFailed...
